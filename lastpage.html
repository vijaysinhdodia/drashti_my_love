Happy Valentine’s Day Drashti❤️❤️.

I know we both understand this may be our last Valentine together, and that our future is not together. I am not trying to change anything or put pressure on you.

What we shared was real and meaningful to me, and I will always respect you and the time we had. Even if our paths are going in different directions, you will always have a special place in my heart.

If you are comfortable with it, I would love to spend some quality time together today. I would really like to spend this Valentine’s Day in your arms, just being close, talking, and sharing a few quiet moments. I don’t expect anything more than that.

Thank you for everything we shared. I wish you peace and happiness, today and always.
      will you spend this veletine night in my arm? if yes then call or msg me

I love you to the Square of infinity Drashti❤️❤️
